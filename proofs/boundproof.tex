Let $x_1 \cdots x_N$ be a population with an unknown mean $\mu$. Suppose we pick a sample without replacement of $y_1 \cdots y_n$. We want to test if the sample sum will have the same sign as the population sum, by using a hypothesis test. Instead of testing for signs directly, sssume WLOG that $S_n > 0$. Let the null hypothesis be $S < 0$. Let: \\
$$S = \sum_{i=1}^N x_i = n\mu \ \  S_n = \sum_{j=1}^n y_j$$

By the bound defined in Serfling in {\it Probability Inequalities for Sum In Sampling Without Replacement}:
$$ P( S_n - S  > t ) \leq   \exp(-2 t^2 * N/ (n (N-n-1)(b-a)^2)) $$
where $a$ and $b$ are bounds on the population. Because $S<0$ iff $S_n - S < S_n$, and because the above bound holds for any $t \geq 0$:
$$ P(S_n - S < S_n) \leq  \exp(-2 S_n^2 * N/ (n (N-n-1)(b-a)^2)) $$
It follows that if:
$$\exp(-2 S_n^2 * N/ (n (N-n-1)(b-a)^2)) < \alpha$$
then we can reject $H_0$ with p-value of $\alpha$, because in that case $P(H_0) < \alpha$.
